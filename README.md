# Desktop_Apps
<p> <strong>Desktop_Apps</strong>, it is a public repository. It contains platform independent desktop applications. As these applications completely developed using python's inbuild library called <strong>tkinter</strong> you no need to install any other packages to use these applications. If there is any need of 3rd party packages then I will mention them in Application's <strong>README.md</strong> file</p>
